# buildevents-orb
Orb for CircleCI to instrument builds with Honeycomb

TBD

In the mean time, the [README for the main buildevents repo](https://github.com/honeycombio/buildevents) has lots of context on how it should be used.

(See a working build as an example: https://github.com/honeycombio/samproxy/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml)
